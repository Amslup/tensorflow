Add to tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc add batchnorm helper
  And associated header

make the wrapper in dnn so baseclass works out.

Add kernel that calls into dnn

figure out how the scale and bias descriptor gets made.
  Possibly with a derive call or something similar

Do the call. Running mean is mutable??? scary...
Figure out a way to manage that... Maybe just pass in a tf.Variable?
