# Development Environment for Visual Studio Code and Docker

This is a community-supported directory. Visual Studio Code and Codespaces are
not officially supported by the TensorFlow team. If you have any questions, ask
@bhack in [the Official TensorFlow forum](https://discuss.tensorflow.org/).

This directory provides a docker setup that can be used with Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
Docker provides an isolated development environment. This should make setup easier
and avoid issues caused by minor differences in the environments used by contributors
and maintainers.

## How to set up a dev environment

1. Install Visual Studio Code and Docker.
2. Install the `Remote - Containers` extension within VSCode.
4. Re-open the folder workspace using the remote containers extension.
   VSCode should recommend this action in a popup. Alternatively,
   use the green button in the bottom left container to control the
   remote extension.
