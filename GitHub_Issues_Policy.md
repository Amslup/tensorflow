If you open a GitHub Issue, here is our policy:
1. It must be a bug/performance issue or a feature request or a documentation issue or a build issue (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
2. Make sure the Issue Template is filled out.
3. The issue should be related to the repo it is created in.

**Here's why we have that policy:** We want to focus on the work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Individual support should be seeked on StackOverflow or other non-GitHub channels. It helps us to address bugs and feature requests in a timely manner.
