  """Bilinear Initializer Operation.

  Computes batch filters with bilinear weights. Result is a
  4D tensor of dimension [H, W, C, N] where:
  (1) H = height of kernel
  (2) W = width of kernel
  (3) C = number of input channels
  (4) N = number of output channels (number of filters)
  Typical use case is weight initialization for deconvolution layer.

  Args:
    shape: A `Tensor` of type `int32`.
      A tensor representing the shape of the filter to be initialized.
    dtype: A `tf.DType` from: `tf.float32, tf.float64`.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

  Returns:
    A 2D tensor initialized with bilinear interpolation.
