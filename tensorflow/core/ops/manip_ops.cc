Rolls the elements of a tensor along an axis.

The elements are shifted positively (towards larger indices) by the offset of
`shift` along the dimension of `axis`. Negative `shift` values will shift
elements in the opposite direction. Elements that roll passed the last position
will wrap around to the first and vice versa. Multiple shifts along multiple
axes may be specified.

For example:

```
# 't' is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
roll(t, shift=2, axis=0) ==> [3, 4, 0, 1, 2]

# shifting along multiple dimensions
# 't' is [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]
roll(t, shift=[1, -2], axis=[0, 1]) ==> [[7, 8, 9, 5, 6], [2, 3, 4, 0, 1]]

# shifting along the same axis multiple times
# 't' is [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]
roll(t, shift=[2, -3], axis=[1, 1]) ==> [[1, 2, 3, 4, 0], [6, 7, 8, 9, 5]]
```

shift: `shift[i]` specifies the number of places by which elements are shifted
  positively (towards larger indices) along the dimension specified by
  `axis[i]`. Negative shifts will roll the elements in the opposite direction.
axis: `axis[i]` specifies the dimension that the shift `shift[i]` should occur.
  if the same axis is referenced more than once, the total shift for that axis
  will be the sum of all the shifts that belong to that axis.
output: Has the same shape and size as the input. The elements are shifted
  positively (towards larger indices) by the offsets of `shift` along the
  dimensions of `axis`.
