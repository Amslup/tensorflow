COMPATIBILITY CHANGES TO PREVIOUS RELEASE
-----------------------------------------

Tools version 14.2.0 is a minor release and is only compatible with previous major
versions < 14.x.x at the source code level. 

There is no binary compatibility with previous major tools versions.

* Support is no longer provided for OSX versions prior to 10.8 (Mountain Lion)

* Support is no longer provided for Centos versions prior to 6.6

* Support is no longer provided for Windows XP

* Support is no longer provided for 32 bit Linux distributions


RESOLVED ISSUES
---------------

* xSCOPE

	* xscope_bytes() does not handle small packet sizes correctly

* xTIMEcomposer Studio

	* QSPI drivers modified so that the clk is not running when the CS is toggled.

* flash programming

	* Options --image-search-page, --image-search-sector and --image-search-address added
	* XS2 boot mode 5, 6 and 7 use the correct TX link speed when PLL is not yet programmed.
	* Fixed boot mode 4 5wire link issue when PLL is not reset

* xC libraries

	* Fixed crt1.S to prevent unneccessary padding bytes

* flash library

	* libflash now accounts for the size of an image as specified by the user as an option to xflash

* runner

	* xrun will display error information from ARM without the need for --verbose

* board support

	* The JTAG speed divider can now be set in the XN file

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

* xmapper/linker

	* xmap sometimes doesn't respond to ctrl-c.
	* An erroneous reference to a static port from a different core is not reported at compile time (traps at run time).

* simulation

	* xsim's handling of xlinks without credit doesn't match the hardware.

* xC compilation

	* In DWARF line number information the directory of an included file is set to the same directory as the compilation directory even if it was included from a subdirectory.
	* Internal compiler error when boolean guard is used with select function.
	* Compiler sometimes incorrectly warnings about structure padding with -Wpadded enabled
	* Reinterpret case of deferenced pointer causes compiler exception

* xTIMEcomposer Studio

	* simulator trace viewer opens when running on hardware
	* Unable to disable a watchpoint once set.
	* Switching workspace in OSX can cause a second xTIMEcomposer dock icon to appear
	* If there are multiple files with the same name, it possible that a breakpoint set on one can be reported as hit in another.
	* Auto-completion not enabled for interface calls
	* Cannot open a new xTIMEcomposer studio from a previously running instance
	* refactor->rename functionality not working in xC code
	* Unable to run with an external (xsim) plugin with no arguments paased.
	* Run does not build if there are no existing binaries.
	* When creating new source file, if a file of the same name already exists, it is overwritten.

* XCC frontend

	* Use of -save-temps causes a compilation failure when two identically named files in different directories are compiled.
	* Compilation fails if the path contains non ASCII characters.

* XMOS build system

	* Build system does not build projects consisting of a single .s file.
	* Makefiles without XCC_FLAGS defined do not work.
	* Using LIBRARY instead of LIBRARIES in library build makefiles does not work in some cases

* other

	* When using XMOS common Makefiles the '-f' or '--makefile' option does not work

* xC libraries

	* The clock type defined in xs1.h clashes with the clock() function in clock.h if both headers are included.

* flash library

	* Flash library data functions do not work unless program image is stored on flash.
	* Flash writing to device AMIC_A25L40PUM fails.

* runner

	* Cannot ctrl-c from 'ERROR : Cannot collect xSCOPE data from device'
	* stdout is printed to stderr.

* c/c++ compilation

	* Error initialising wchar_t array with wide string (c++)

* timing analysis

	* Script editor doesn't update syntax highlighting after edit.
	* XTA doesn't support timing across select functions.

* xas assembler

	* xas sometimes doesn't respond correctly to ctrl-c.

* debugger

	* Attaching to a running system which has taken an exception does not allow automatic backtrace
	* Step-through to logical core 0 not working
